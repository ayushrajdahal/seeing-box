# Seeing Box

SeeingBox is a Raspberry pi-based Blind Assistance System Prototype that comprehends the Object/Scene kept in front of its Camera in the form of Text, which is later converted to Audio via Speakers/Headphones. It uses Microsoft Cognitive Services API, and hence, requires an internet connection. This was built over a few days in BNKS Science Fest 2019.
